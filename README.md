# Helm SSM Plugin

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/d3cd080edd8644e085f2f8adfd43510c)](https://www.codacy.com?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=codacy/helm-ssm&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/codacy/helm-ssm.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/codacy/helm-ssm)

This is a **helm3** plugin to help developers inject values coming from AWS SSM
parameters, on the `values.yaml` file. It also leverages the wonderful [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/)
package, thus making all its functions available when parsing.

Since **helm2 is deprecated** the current version of the plugin only supports helm3. The last version
to support helm2 is [v2.2.1](https://github.com/codacy/helm-ssm/releases/tag/2.2.1). There will be
no further patches or updates to this legacy version.

## Usage

Loads a template file,  and writes the output.

Simply add placeholders like `{{ssm "path" "option1=value1" }}` in your
file, where you want it to be replaced by the plugin.

Currently the plugin supports the following options:

- `region=eu-west-1` - to resolve that parameter in a specific region
- `default=some-value` - to give a default **string** value when the ssm parameter is optional. The plugin will throw an error when values are not defined and do not have a default.
- `prefix=/something` - you can use this to specify a given prefix for a parameter without affecting the path. It will be concatenated with the path before resolving.

### Values file

```yaml
service:
ingress:
  enabled: false
  hosts:
    - service.{{ssm "/exists/subdomain" }}
    - service1.{{ssm "/empty/subdomain" "default=codacy.org" }}
    - service2.{{ssm "/exists/subdomain" "default=codacy.org" "region=eu-west-1" }}
    - service3.{{ssm "/subdomain" "default=codacy.org" "region=eu-west-1" "prefix=/empty" }}
    - service4.{{ssm "/securestring" }}

```

when you do not want a key to be defined, you can use a condition and an empty default value:

```yaml
service:
ingress:
  enabled: false
  hosts:
    {{- with $subdomain := (ssm "/exists/subdomain" "default=") }}{{ if $subdomain }}
    - service.{{$subdomain}}
    {{- end }}{{- end }}

```

### Command

```sh
$ helm ssm [flags]
```

### Flags

```sh
  -c, --clean                   clean all template commands from file
  -d, --dry-run                 doesn't replace the file content
  -h, --help                    help for ssm
  -p, --profile string          aws profile to fetch the ssm parameters
  -t, --tag-cleaned string      replace cleaned template commands with given string
  -o, --target-dir string       dir to output content
  -f, --values valueFilesList   specify values in a YAML file (can specify multiple) (default [])
  -v, --verbose                 show the computed YAML values file/s
```
